We utilize the "ambient_temperature_system_failure.csv" dataset from the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB). 
This dataset comprises time-series data capturing ambient temperature readings from a system that encountered a failure.
Using the Pandas library, we read the CSV file directly from GitHub and store it in a variable named "data".
